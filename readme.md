**Laan.Mvc.RequireJs.Experiments**This project was built to experiment with an architectural for using RequireJs within an ASP.NET MVC Web application, and since most RequireJs tutorials and samples are either for other platforms, OSes, or are for Single Page Applications, I thought I'd put something together myself.My overall goal is to get structured, modular, testable JavaScript integrated into a standard server-oriented MVC application so I built this project to see what the issues are - and practice my JavaScript along the way.I also implemented a rich-client entity model for supporting automatic read/write of named properties (via jQuery), as well as automatic dirty checking.Technologies I've explored in this repository are:* [ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc) - just a basic application. No particular usage.* [RequireJs](http://requirejs.org/) - asynchronous modular loader for javascript* [R.js](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html) - first experiments with a post build process with nodejs and  script optimisation, uglification, etc.* [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) - handy for all the functions you don't want to write yourself, but you always need* [JQuery](http://jquery.com) - mostly I've used this because the production app I will be apply these learnings to already uses it, and the devs know it. My goal is to hide it as much as possible!* [MomentJs](http://momentjs.com/) - I didn't need it for this project, but did want to ensure that it would integrate since we are using it in some places* [KnockoutJs](http://knockoutjs.com) - Just to verify the integration with RequireJs. I need to do more here!* [QUnit](https://qunitjs.com/) - Javascript unit testing. To verify my code works, of course. Also, to verify that it would work with RequireJsI hope you like it. Any feedback will be appreciatedBen Laan
